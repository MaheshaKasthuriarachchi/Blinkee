                        to Matt<br>
                        Thanks Matt. I want to take a moment to let you know that your products are helping my 17 months
                        old son a great deal. He was born 3 months premature and had laser eye surgery at about 6 months
                        of age for Retinopathy of Prematurity. As a result, he currently has some degree of visual
                        impairment. His doctor believes that his prognosis for the future is very good but currently
                        requires vision therapy (lighted toys help a great deal with this therapy). With proper therapy,
                        he should be able to do everything other kids can do and should be just fine visually. He just
                        needs time to re-train his eyes to function to their maximum potential. Anyway, I wanted you to
                        know that not only are providing fun to the average person purchasing your products, but helping
                        a little boy to have a normal future and have fun in the process.<br>

                        Hi Mr. Jacobs, <br>

                        Your product arrived as promised in due time.
                        My four year old is absolutely captivated with his
                        new light saber, and cannot wait to dress up as Luke
                        for Halloween.<br>

                        Many thanks. <br>

                        to matt<br>
                        Hi Matt, <br>

                        Congratulations on your recent wedding. Beautiful picture! I wanted to share what a hit the pink
                        fedora hats were at the Newport Seafood and Wine Fest last month. We couldn’t walk more than a
                        few feet without someone commenting on how spectacular the hats were, how we looked and asking
                        where we got them. When I purchased them we planned to wear them Friday night only, but after
                        the overwhelming response we wore them all weekend. I hope this generates future business for
                        blinkee.com as we were around 15,000 of our closest friends. haha Not sure if you have a gallery
                        but your welcome to use the pictures. The other pic is our dog Bella … a very good sport 🙂 <br>

                        Thanks again for the memories. We look forward to doing future business. <br>

                        Cheers, Shelley Johnson

                        Hey Matt,<br>

                        I took a little time today to try and take a few pictures of my car with the blinky’s I
                        purchased from you. Although the pictures are not as great as I wished they could be (it was my
                        first time shooting night pictures), I think the images say enough. Anyway, I’ve put together a
                        ‘web page’ of sorts to show you what topics I would hit on for your copy. The link you can
                        access it by is at the bottom of this email. You want to touch on the ‘no permanent installation
                        work required’ aspect, because I’ve got undercarriage neons on my car, and the install for those
                        was not what you’d consider fun, and other car enthusiasts would agree, I’m sure. You also want
                        to talk about the versatility – never the same design twice, multiple color selections, some
                        flash, some don’t. Make sure you mention the night light shows, too.

                        Also, I spoke to the guy I got your company name from yesterday, and he is going to get me some
                        still shots of his car all lit up, as he says he typically uses hundreds of your lights on his
                        car when at night shows. He said it’d be cool if you used them, as well. I also have a couple of
                        video snips of my car lit up, and I’m happy to share them with you if you would like. I must
                        say, I was very impressed that of the 85 lights I received, only 1 of them had batteries that
                        were used up already. I can’t wait to use them in the next night lights show I will attend!

                        Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else! <br>

                        Here’s the web page listing, but just know that there are no links to this page, as it is just
                        something for you to see.

                        Thanks, <br>

                        Thanks Matt. I want to take a moment to let you know that your products are helping my 17 months
                        old son a great deal. He was born 3 months premature and had laser eye surgery at about 6 months
                        of age for Retinopathy of Prematurity. As a result, he currently has some degree of visual
                        impairment. His doctor believes that his prognosis for the future is very good but currently
                        requires vision therapy (lighted toys help a great deal with this therapy). With proper therapy,
                        he should be able to do everything other kids can do and should be just fine visually. He just
                        needs time to re-train his eyes to function to their maximum potential. Anyway, I wanted you to
                        know that not only are providing fun to the average person purchasing your products, but helping
                        a little boy to have a normal future and have fun in the process.<br>

                        Hi Matt, <br>

                        Congratulations on your recent wedding. Beautiful picture! I wanted to share what a hit the pink
                        fedora hats were at the Newport Seafood and Wine Fest last month. We couldn’t walk more than a
                        few feet without someone commenting on how spectacular the hats were, how we looked and asking
                        where we got them. When I purchased them we planned to wear them Friday night only, but after
                        the overwhelming response we wore them all weekend. I hope this generates future business for
                        blinkee.com as we were around 15,000 of our closest friends. haha Not sure if you have a gallery
                        but your welcome to use the pictures. The other pic is our dog Bella … a very good sport 🙂 <br>

                        Thanks again for the memories. We look forward to doing future business. <br>

                        Hey Matt,<br>

                        I took a little time today to try and take a few pictures of my car with the blinky’s I
                        purchased from you. Although the pictures are not as great as I wished they could be (it was my
                        first time shooting night pictures), I think the images say enough. Anyway, I’ve put together a
                        ‘web page’ of sorts to show you what topics I would hit on for your copy. The link you can
                        access it by is at the bottom of this email. You want to touch on the ‘no permanent installation
                        work required’ aspect, because I’ve got undercarriage neons on my car, and the install for those
                        was not what you’d consider fun, and other car enthusiasts would agree, I’m sure. You also want
                        to talk about the versatility – never the same design twice, multiple color selections, some
                        flash, some don’t. Make sure you mention the night light shows, too.

                        Also, I spoke to the guy I got your company name from yesterday, and he is going to get me some
                        still shots of his car all lit up, as he says he typically uses hundreds of your lights on his
                        car when at night shows. He said it’d be cool if you used them, as well. I also have a couple of
                        video snips of my car lit up, and I’m happy to share them with you if you would like. I must
                        say, I was very impressed that of the 85 lights I received, only 1 of them had batteries that
                        were used up already. I can’t wait to use them in the next night lights show I will attend!

                        Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else! <br>

                        Here’s the web page listing, but just know that there are no links to this page, as it is just
                        something for you to see.

                        Thanks, <br>

                        I just wanted you to know that I DID receive the Nutcracker blinking pins in time and sold out
                        in one hour!
                        Thanks so much for your help and I look forward to doing business with you in the future.<br>
